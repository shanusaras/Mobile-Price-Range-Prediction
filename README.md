# **Project Title**  
**Mobile Price Range Prediction and Business Insights for Competitive Strategy**  

## **1. Executive Summary**  

### **Objective**  
To predict the price range of mobile phones based on their specifications and provide actionable business insights to help Bob's company compete effectively with industry leaders like Apple and Samsung.  

### **Context**  
This project uses **Python**, **SQL**, and **machine learning algorithms** to perform in-depth data analysis and predictive modeling. The analysis highlights the relationship between mobile specifications (RAM, battery power, camera quality, etc.) and price range to guide Bob's company in developing a competitive strategy.  



## **2. Business Problem**  

### **Problem Identification**  
Bob's company lacks a data-driven mechanism to estimate the price range of its mobile phones based on specifications, making it challenging to compete with market leaders. This necessitates the creation of a predictive model to classify price ranges and provide insights into factors influencing mobile pricing.  

### **Business Impact**  
Failing to identify competitive pricing strategies could lead to:  
- Inefficient resource allocation in production.  
- Low market penetration due to misaligned product features and pricing.  
- Missed opportunities for profit maximization in high-demand segments.  

Accurate pricing and feature targeting can improve product competitiveness, drive sales, and strengthen Bob's brand positioning in the mobile market.  



## **3. Methodology**  

### **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
- **Imputation**: Managed missing and irrational data points (e.g., mobile depth, pixel resolution height).  
- **Feature Engineering**: Normalized numeric features and encoded categorical variables.  
- **Data Validation**: Validated relationships between features to avoid losing valuable information during feature selection.  

### **Analysis Techniques**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated trends, correlations, and feature distributions.  
- **Feature Importance**: Identified key features such as RAM, battery power, and internal memory impacting the price range.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Trained 10 models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned the SVM model using scaling techniques, achieving the highest accuracy (95%).  



## **4. Skills**  

### **Tools, Languages, & Software**  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: SVM, Decision Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting  
- **Database Querying**: SQL  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  



## **5. Results & Business Recommendations**  

### **Model Performance**  
- The tuned **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** achieved the highest accuracy of **95%**, offering a robust and generalized solution.  

### **Insights**  
- **Key Features Driving Price Range**:  
  - **RAM**: High correlation with price; increasing RAM capacity boosts perceived value.  
  - **Battery Power**: Significant influence; larger battery capacity improves customer satisfaction.  
  - **Internal Memory**: Directly linked to price; customers prefer phones with more storage.  
- **Technological Trends**:  
  - Features like dual SIM, camera quality, and 4G connectivity strongly affect pricing decisions.  
  - Lightweight, slim phones with user-friendly interfaces are more attractive to busy customers.  
- **Customer Preferences**:  
  - Higher price ranges correspond to devices offering the latest technological advancements.  

### **Business Recommendations**  
1. **Focus on Key Features**: Invest in improving RAM, battery power, and internal memory specifications.  
2. **Innovate & Differentiate**: Incorporate cutting-edge features (e.g., better cameras, lightweight designs).  
3. **Optimize Branding**: Run targeted marketing campaigns highlighting the unique value of Bobâ€™s company.  
4. **Customer Retention**: Develop user-friendly, portable designs to align with modern customer lifestyles.  



## **6. Next Steps**
